# Custom Invoice Header for Odoo

## Overview

The Custom Invoice Header module enhances Odoo's invoice reporting functionality by adding the invoice number to the header of PDF reports from the second page onwards. This module is designed for Odoo 16 and integrates seamlessly with the existing invoice layout.

## Features

- Displays the invoice number in the header of PDF reports starting from the second page
- Maintains the original invoice header layout, including company logo and details
- Only affects PDF reports, leaving other report types unchanged
- Compatible with Odoo 16

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the module files.
2. Place the `custom_invoice_header` folder in your Odoo addons directory.
3. Update the module list in Odoo:
   - Enable developer mode
   - Go to Apps > Update Apps List
4. Search for "Custom Invoice Header" in the Apps menu and install the module.

## Usage

Once installed, the module automatically applies the custom header to PDF invoice reports. No additional configuration is required.

To see the changes:
1. Generate a PDF invoice report with multiple pages.
2. Observe that from the second page onwards, the invoice number appears in the header on the right side.

## Technical Details

The module works by extending the `web.external_layout_standard` template and modifying the header structure for PDF reports. It uses Odoo's `report_type` context variable to ensure the custom header is only applied to PDF outputs.
